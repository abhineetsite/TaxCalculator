# TaxCalculator
A simple console application which calculates your taxes. 

This program uses the tax brackets and rates for the 2022 tax year and assumes that the taxpayer is a resident of the United States and only subject to federal taxes. It does not take into account any state, local, or other taxes that may apply. Additionally, this is just a simple example and does not cover all possible scenarios or the entire federal tax code. It is not intended to provide professional tax advice and should not be used as such. For a complete and accurate determination of your tax liability, please consult a tax professional or use tax software.
